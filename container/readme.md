checking if pipeline triggers when changes are only in container

so a pipeline only triggers when changes  paths:
      - "container/**" happens in the defined  files and change in the container here and now i am using configure-aws-credentials change
      - Invalidate the html file available on cloud front and setting the secret variable

      --Echoing the distribution id of cloud front
